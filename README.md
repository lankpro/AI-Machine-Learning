# AI-Machine-Learning

## Important notes
This library has a dependency on the **nblas** package for fast matrix operations. It should work by default on OSX, but on Linux you may need to run ``apt-get install libblas-dev`` first. On Windows you may need to install [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/#_lapack_version_3_7_0_2).

This library is in an early development phase and many **breaking changes are to be expected**.

The TypeScript source files can be found on GitHub and the JavaScript production files(including .ts.d files) can be found as an npm package.

## Documentation

Below are some simple code usage examples. TypeDocs for all classes can be found here.

* [Feedforward Neural Network](#feedforward-neural-network)
* [Linear Regression](#linear-regression)
* [Logistic Regression](#logistic-regression)
* [Multiclass Logistic Regression](#multiclass-logistic-regression)
* [Nearest Neighbors](#nearest-neighbors)

Please follow the provided links to access more detailed information and example usage of each machine learning class.
